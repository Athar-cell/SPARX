# 🧠 SPARX — Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System

SPARX (Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System) is an **AI-based sports analytics tool** designed to help athletes, coaches, and fitness trainers **monitor performance and predict injury risk** using machine learning.

This prototype was developed for the **SportsTech Hackathon 2025** — Stage 2 (Software-based Solution Submission).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Prediction** — Predicts injury risk based on workload, fatigue, and recovery.
- **Smart Recommendations** — Suggests rest, recovery, or low-impact sessions when risk is high.
- **Manual Input & CSV Upload** — Users can input athlete data manually or upload batch training logs.
- **Visual Insights Dashboard** — Displays risk distribution and quick insights for multiple athletes.
- **Lightweight Streamlit App** — Simple UI built with Streamlit for quick demo and prototype evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`sample_data.csv`) is **synthetic**, generated to simulate real athlete training logs.

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `training_duration` | Duration of training session (minutes) |
| `rpe` | Rate of Perceived Exertion (1–10 scale) |
| `sleep_hours` | Hours of sleep before the session |
| `prev_injuries` | Whether athlete had a prior injury (0/1) |
| `sprint_distance` | Distance covered in meters |
| `avg_hr` | Average heart rate during session |
| `injury` | Target variable (1 = injured, 0 = not injured) |

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SPARX-prototype.git
cd SPARX-prototype
Run the Model & App

#### How to Use the Dashboard

Manual Input (Sidebar): Enter athlete data (training duration, RPE, etc.) and click "Predict".

Upload CSV: Upload a CSV with the same columns as sample_data.csv to test multiple athletes at once.

View Results:

Injury risk (0–1 probability)

Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)

Recommendations for training intensity

 ####Machine Learning Model

Model Type: Logistic Regression

Target: Injury (1 = injured)

Output: Probability of injury and discrete risk levels

Current Accuracy: ~75–80% (on synthetic data)

Next Upgrade: Add RandomForest / XGBoost for real datasets.

### Future Scope

✅ Integrate real sports datasets (from Kaggle / athlete trackers)
✅ Use wearable sensor data (heart rate, GPS, speed)
✅ Add trend analytics & personalized dashboards
✅ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces
✅ Build mobile-friendly UI
