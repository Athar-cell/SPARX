# 🧠 SPARX — Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System

SPARX (Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System) is an **AI-based sports analytics tool** designed to help athletes, coaches, and fitness trainers **monitor performance and predict injury risk** using machine learning.

This prototype was developed for the **SportsTech Hackathon 2025** — Stage 2 (Software-based Solution Submission).

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Prediction** — Predicts injury risk based on workload, fatigue, and recovery.
- **Smart Recommendations** — Suggests rest, recovery, or low-impact sessions when risk is high.
- **Manual Input & CSV Upload** — Users can input athlete data manually or upload batch training logs.
- **Visual Insights Dashboard** — Displays risk distribution and quick insights for multiple athletes.
- **Lightweight Streamlit App** — Simple UI built with Streamlit for quick demo and prototype evaluation.
