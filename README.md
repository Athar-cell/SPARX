# 🧠 SPARX — Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System

SPARX (Sports Performance & Injury Risk Analytics System) is an **AI-based sports analytics tool** designed to help athletes, coaches, and fitness trainers **monitor performance and predict injury risk** using machine learning.

This prototype was developed for the **SportsTech Hackathon 2025 — Stage 2 (Software-based Solution Submission).**

---

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Prediction** — Predicts injury risk based on workload, fatigue, and recovery.  
- **Smart Recommendations** — Suggests rest, recovery, or low-impact sessions when risk is high.  
- **Manual Input & CSV Upload** — Users can input athlete data manually or upload batch training logs.  
- **Visual Insights Dashboard** — Displays risk distribution and quick insights for multiple athletes.  
- **Lightweight Streamlit App** — Simple UI built with Streamlit for quick demo and prototype evaluation.

## 🧩 Technology Stack

| Component | Tools Used |
|------------|-------------|
| **Language** | Python 3 |
| **Machine Learning** | Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression) |
| **Dashboard / UI** | Streamlit |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Model Persistence** | Joblib |
| **Visualization** | Matplotlib, Plotly |
| **Dataset** | Synthetic dataset (`sample_data.csv`) generated by statistical simulation |

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`sample_data.csv`) is **synthetic**, generated to simulate real athlete training logs.

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `training_duration` | Duration of training session (minutes) |
| `rpe` | Rate of Perceived Exertion (1–10 scale) |
| `sleep_hours` | Hours of sleep before the session |
| `prev_injuries` | Whether athlete had a prior injury (0/1) |
| `sprint_distance` | Distance covered in meters |
| `avg_hr` | Average heart rate during session |
| `injury` | Target variable (1 = injured, 0 = not injured) |

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SPARX-prototype.git
cd SPARX-prototype

## 💻 How to Use the Dashboard

Once the Streamlit app is running (`streamlit run app.py`), open the link shown in your terminal — usually:


The dashboard allows you to **predict injury risk** in two ways:  
through **Manual Input (single athlete)** or **CSV Upload (multiple athletes)**.

---

### 🧍‍♂️ Manual Input (Single Athlete)

1. Open the **left sidebar** in the app.
2. Enter the following athlete parameters:
   - **Training Duration (minutes)** — e.g., 60  
   - **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)** — 1 to 10 scale  
   - **Sleep Hours** — number of hours slept before the session  
   - **Previous Injuries** — 1 if yes, 0 if no  
   - **Sprint Distance (meters)** — total sprint distance in the session  
   - **Average Heart Rate** — beats per minute during training  
3. Click **“Predict (manual)”** to generate the result.
4. The dashboard will display:
   - **Injury Risk Score (0–1)**  
   - **Risk Level:** Low / Medium / High  
   - **Recommendation:** e.g., "Reduce intensity" or "Take rest day"

---

### 📁 CSV Upload (Multiple Athletes)

1. Prepare a CSV file with the following columns:
2. Click **“Upload CSV”** and select your file.
3. The app will automatically:
- Predict injury risk for each athlete  
- Assign risk levels (Low, Medium, High)  
- Display results in a sortable table  
4. Below the table, you’ll see:
- **Risk Distribution Chart** (bar chart by risk category)  
- **Training Duration vs Injury Risk** (scatter plot)  
- **Feature Importance Graph** (if available from model)

---

### 🧠 Example Use Case

- You’re a **coach** tracking 10 athletes’ weekly workloads.  
- After uploading their data:
- SPARX flags 3 athletes with **High Injury Risk**  
- Suggests lower intensity or recovery workouts for them  
- Others continue with normal or progressive training load  

---

### 🏁 Summary

✅ **Manual Input** → Quick single prediction  
✅ **CSV Upload** → Batch analysis for multiple athletes  
✅ **Visual Charts** → Easy to interpret risk patterns and training insights  

---

> 💡 *Tip:* You can customize the app by editing `app.py` — change thresholds, color themes, or add new charts for your dataset.
🧠 Machine Learning Model

Model Type: Logistic Regression

Target: Injury (1 = injured)

Output: Probability of injury and discrete risk levels

Accuracy: ~75–80% (on synthetic data)

Next Upgrade: Add RandomForest / XGBoost with real datasets

🌱 Future Scope

✅ Integrate real sports datasets (from Kaggle / athlete trackers)
✅ Use wearable sensor data (heart rate, GPS, speed)
✅ Add trend analytics & personalized dashboards
✅ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces
✅ Build mobile-friendly UI
